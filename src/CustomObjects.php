/*
 * CustomObjects allows users to create their own custom SVG paths and use
 * them as box types with a2s:type references.
 *
 * Paths must have width and height set, and must not span multiple lines.
 * Multiple paths can be specified, one path per line. All objects must
 * reside in the same directory.
 *
 * File operations are horribly slow, so we make a best effort to avoid
 * as many as possible:
 *
 *  * If the directory mtime hasn't changed, we attempt to load our
 *    objects from a cache file.
 *
 *  * If this file doesn't exist, can't be read, or the mtime has
 *    changed, we scan the directory and update files that have changed
 *    based on their mtime.
 *
 *  * We attempt to save our cache in a temporary directory. It's volatile
 *    but also requires no configuration.
 *
 * We could do a bit better by utilizing APC's shared memory storage, which
 * would help greatly when running on a server.
 *
 * Note that the path parser isn't foolproof, mostly because PHP isn't the
 * greatest language ever for implementing a parser.
